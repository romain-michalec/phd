This repository contains an overview of the work I did as a Ph.D. student at the Atomic Energy Commission in France (Interactive Simulation Laboratory, Department of Robotics and Virtual Reality). The focus of this work is the control of multifingered dextrous manipulation in humanoid robotics. It was defended in December 2011.
